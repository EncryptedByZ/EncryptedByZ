Welcome to the zChat app for Android!

As an Android user, I take privacy very seriously. I know how irritating it is when apps collect your data without your knowledge.

I have not programmed this app to collect any personally identifiable information.
For zChat app doesn't need to access your Camera, Location, Phone details, Files or something else where your identity could be reveal.

zChat app was created for private chat not for data collect. All what is needed for zChat is PIN code to secure your conversations.

After 3 failed PIN code attempts - all necessary data will be removed.

All messages automatically will be removed after 2 hours when message status will be changed to READ.

If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently caused by me, or have any question regarding how the app protectes your privacy, please send me an email and I will surely try to fix it/help you.

Yours sincerely,
Z.
